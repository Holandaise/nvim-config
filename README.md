# Personal Neovim config 100% lua

## Simplicity

I don't like having a bunch of plugins all tying together and creating keymappings
that I'll never use, or even know about. In my config, I wanted something clean
and easy to navigate and extend in the future.

## Telescope

I've been watching some videos from TJ Devries, who authored Telescope. I understand
that it hooks into ripgrep to provide a simple picker/finder for all kinds of things.
There's still some more here for me to learn and create keymappings in the future for
more useful commands.

## TODO

* Need to learn how to set the statusline. Again I don't want anything fancy.
